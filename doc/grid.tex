\chapter{Grid}\label{sec:grid}

The equations are solved using Cartesian co-ordinates and the grid is structured. The grid is constructed by building up the three directions separately (in a 2D case, $Oz$ has simply one node).  Each direction is broken into segments, and each of those segments is built with specified generation algorithms. The first node in each direction is set at zero.

The executable is {\tt inigrid.x} and the data in {\tt tlab.ini} is specified in the blocks [IniGridOx], [IniGridOy] and [IniGridOz]. Once created, basic information about the grid is saved into the file {\tt grid.sts}. Grid transformations can be done with {\tt transgrid.x}; the corresponding sources are in the {\tt tools/transform} sub-directory. They allow to print out an ASCII file with the grid positions, add an offset, drop or introduce planes and make a scaling.% (As in the case of the utilities of the main code, a browse through them is recommended, though they are really simple.)

\section{Generation algorithms}

\subsection{Explicit mappings}
The reference is a grid with a uniform spacing:
\begin{equation}
  \{s_j=h_0(j-1):\, j = 1,\ldots,n\} \;.
\end{equation}
Then, one considers different mappings from this reference grid to the final grid $\{x_j=x(s_j)\}$.

For {\tt opts=tanh}, the mapping $x=x(s)$ is obtained by solving the equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}s} = 1 + \frac{h_1/h_0-1}{2}\left[ 1 + \tanh\left(\frac{s-s_{t1}}{2\delta_1}\right)\right] \;,
\end{equation}
that is, the grid step $\Delta x \equiv\mathrm{d}x/\mathrm{d}j$ varies according to a hyperbolic tangent function between the uniform values $h_0$ and $h_1$, the transition occurring at $s=s_{t1}$ and over a length $\delta_1$. The grid step $h_0$ corresponds to that of the initial uniform grid. The parameters $s_{t1}$, $h_1/h_0$ and $\delta_1$ are provided in the corresponding {\tt vals} record of the {\tt tlab.ini} file.

The mapping can be written explicitly as
\begin{equation}
  x = s + (h_1/h_0-1)\delta_1\left\{\ln(1+\exp[(s-s_{t1})/2])+C\right\}
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the integration constant, defined such that $x=0$ for $s=0$. The final extension obeys the relationship
\begin{equation}
  x_\mathrm{max}=s_\mathrm{max} + (h_1/h_0-1)\delta_1\ln\left[\frac{\exp(s_\mathrm{max}/\delta_1)+1}{1+\exp(-s_{t1}/\delta_1)}\right].
\end{equation}
where $s_\mathrm{max} =(n-1)h_0$.

Two transitions are possible if the {\tt vals} record contains 6 elements instead of 3:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dx}{ds} = 1
+ \frac{h_1/h_0-1}{2}\left[ 1 + \tanh\left(\frac{s-s_{t1}}{2\delta_1}\right)\right]
+ \frac{h_2/h_0-1}{2}\left[ 1 + \tanh\left(\frac{s-s_{t2}}{2\delta_2}\right)\right]\;.
\end{equation}

For {\tt opts=exp}, the mapping $x=x(s)$ is obtained by solving the equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2x}{\mathrm{d}s^2} - (f/h_0)\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}s} = 0 \;,
\end{equation}
where the stretching factor is imposed according to a hyperbolic tangent function
\begin{equation}
f = \frac{\Delta f_1}{2}\left[ 1 + \tanh\left(\frac{s-s_{t1}}{2\delta_1}\right)\right] \;.
\end{equation}
The stretching factor is defined as $f\equiv\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}x (\Delta x)$, so that $f+1$ an approximation to the ratio $(\Delta x)_{j+1}/(\Delta x) _{j}$. The non-dimensional parameter $f$ then varies from $0$ to $\Delta f_1$; values smaller that $0.1$ are recommended (less that 10\% stretching). The parameters $s_{t1}$, $\Delta f_1$ and $\delta_1$ are provided in the corresponding {\tt vals} record of the {\tt tlab.ini} file.

A first integral of this problem leads to
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}s} =
\left[1+\exp\left(\frac{s-s_{t1}}{\delta_1}\right)\right]^{\delta_1(\Delta f_1/h_0)} \;.
\end{equation}
This equation for $x(s)$ needs to be solved numerically, but already shows that this mapping leads to an exponential growth of the grid spacing $\Delta x$ and the grid $x(s)$. Note that $\delta_1$ admits negative values.

Two transitions are possible if the {\tt vals} record contains 6 elements instead of 3:
\begin{equation}
  f = \frac{\Delta f_1}{2}\left[ 1 + \tanh\left(\frac{s-s_{t1}}{2\delta_1}\right)\right]
  + \frac{\Delta f_2}{2}\left[ 1 + \tanh\left(\frac{s-s_{t2}}{2\delta_2}\right)\right] \;,
\end{equation}
which implies
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}s} =
  \left[1+\exp\left(\frac{s-s_{t1}}{\delta_1}\right)\right]^{\delta_1(\Delta f_1/h_0)}
  \left[1+\exp\left(\frac{s-s_{t2}}{\delta_2}\right)\right]^{\delta_2(\Delta f_2/h_0)}\;.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Geometric progression}

These algorithms correspond to {\tt opts=1-4}. (It has not been used in a long time.)

For each segment $i$ the geometric ratio $r_i$ is given (input variable $val1$). The rest of the constrains are the number of points in each segment, $n_i$ and the total length in that direction, $L$.  The first step of the first segment is initialized to 1 (this number does not matter because of the final scaling), and then the first segment is generated. The last step size is taken as the first one for the second segment, and the sequence continue until the last segment. A final rescaling adjusts the physical length of the grid in that direction.

The length of each segment in the grid is saved into {\tt grid.sts}. For calculating them, if we denote the length of each segment by $l_i$, we have
\begin{equation}
l_i = h_i^1(1+r_i+r_i^2+\ldots+r_i^{n_i-2})=
h_i^1\frac{1-r_i^{n_i-1}}{1-r_i}=h_i^1C_i \;.
\end{equation}
The first step $h_i^1$ of each segment is related to the previous one by
\begin{equation}
h_{i+1}^1 = h_i^1 r_i^{n_i-1}
\end{equation}
and the equation to close the problem is
\begin{equation}
L=\sum_{seg}l_i=h_1^1\left( C_1 + r_1^{n_1-1}C_2 +
r_1^{n_1-1}r_2^{n_2-1}C_3 + \ldots \right) \;.
\end{equation}
